# Restart-Krita
A restarting script for Krita with Session Reload (not the build in one) including new unsaved documents . Unsaved and modified documents get saved to tempfiles, all opened documents are reloaded after restart.

Behaviour is similar to when Clipstudio or Photoshop crash , they also reload all pics including unsaved documents. But here you can enforce it if you need a Krita restart or a full PC reboot ... or if you just arent a friend of sleeping pcs but still wanna pick up where you left next day after booting your pc up.

It has two options: 

1) restart directly (if Krita lost pen pressure or begins lagging) 
2) save the session and quit Krita (for later )

Much thanx to Grum999 https://github.com/grum999 for helping me and showing me the basics of krita python coding.
